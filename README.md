# Trojan
# READ_ME Trojan

# The ZIP file contains a legitimate Mozilla Firefox Update Launcher and a READ_ME file
# The READ_ME file is actually an application that executes 3 scripts 
# Script 1 erases all cookies and cache from internet browsers, forcing the user to retype all login information
# Script 2 downloads a backdoor from a remote server and executes it in the background, as well as downloading a decoy READ_ME file and opens it
# Script 3 download and hides a keylogger, which will log all keystrokes and report them via the reverse connection/email

# persistence, such as tieing to a background process upon startup,  is still to be added
